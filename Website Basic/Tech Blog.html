<p><font size="+2" align="right" >The term ‘diaspora’ comes from the Greek, which means scattered or dispersed. ‘Diaspora’ originally referred 
to major historical migrations, such as the scattering of the Jews from Israel. Although the term refers to the physical dispersal
of Jews throughout the world, it also carries religious, philosophical, political, and eschatological connotations, in as much as
Jews perceive a special relationship between the land of Israel and themselves. Other instances include the colonial expansion of 
the Greeks, the removal through slavery of millions of Africans, and the exile of Armenians following massacres by the Turks in
the early twentieth century.Some notable diasporas are the Assyrian Diaspora which originated during and after the Arab conquest of Iraq,
Syria, Turkey and Iran, and continued in the aftermath of the Assyrian genocide, the southern Chinese and Indians who left their
homelands during the 19th to 20th century, the Irish who left Ireland during and after the Great Famine, the Scots who emigrated on
a large scale after the Highland and Lowland Clearances, the Romani from India, the Italian diaspora and the Mexican diaspora,
the exile and deportation of Circassian, the Palestinian diaspora following the flight or expulsion of Arabs from Palestine, 
the Armenian Diaspora following the Armenian genocide, the Lebanese Diaspora due to the Lebanese Civil War, the fleeing of Greeks 
from Turkey after the fall of Constantinople, the later Greek genocide, and the Istanbul pogroms, and the emigration of Anglo-Saxon
warriors and their families after the Norman Conquest, primarily to the Byzantine Empire.
<br>
Recently, scholars have distinguished between different kinds of diaspora, based on its causes such as colonialism, trade or labor
migrations, or by the kind of social coherence within the diaspora community and its ties to the ancestral lands. Some diaspora communities
maintain strong political ties with their homeland. Other qualities that may be typical of many diasporas are thoughts of return, keeping ties
back home (country of origin) relationships with other communities in the diaspora, and lack of full integration into the host countries.
Diasporas often maintain ties to the country of their historical affiliation and influence the policies of the country where they are located.</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">British Indians are citizens of the United Kingdom (UK) whose ancestral roots are from India. This includes people
born in the UK who are of Indian origin as well as Indians who have migrated to the UK. Today, Indians comprise about 1.4 million people in the UK, making them
the single largest visible ethnic minority population in the country. They make up the largest subgroup of British Asians and are one of the
largest Indian communities in the Indian diaspora, mainly due to the Indian–British relations (including historical links such as India having been part of
the British Empire and still being part of the Commonwealth of Nations). The British Indian community is the sixth largest in the Indian diaspora, behind
the Indian communities in the United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and Nepal. The majority of British Indians are of Punjabi
and Gujarati descent, with smaller communities of Tamilian, Bengali, Malayali, Konkani, Marathi and Telugu communities.</FONT></P><br>

<font face="Franklin Gothic book" size="+3" color="#035690" align="right"><b><u>18th Century</u>.</b></font><br>
<br><font align="right" size="+2">People from India have settled in Great Britain since the East India Company (EIC) recruited
 lascars to replace vacancies in their crews on East Indiamen whilst on voyages in India. Initially these were men from the
 Indo-Portuguese or Luso-Asian communities of the subcontinent, including men from Bombay, Goa, Cochin, Madras and the Hugli
 River in Bengal. Later Bengali Muslims and men from Ratnagiri were hired. Many were then unable to obtain passage back due to
 the price and had no alternative than to settle in London. There were also some ayahs, domestic servants and nannies of wealthy
 British families, who accompanied their employers back to Britain when their stay in South Asia came to an end. British soldiers
 would also sometimes marry Indian women and send their children back to Britain, although the wife often did not accompany them.
 Indian wives of British soldiers would sometimes ask for passage home after being divorced or widowed if they did accompany their 
 children. In 1835, the husband (a British soldier serving in His Majesty's 1st Foot Regiment) of Bridget Peter, a native of Madras,
 passed away. She petitioned the Directors from Chelsea Hospital 'in a state of destitution' to pay for her return to India. 
 They agreed to pay to return her and her three children.</FONT></P><br>
 <p><font size="+2">During the 19th century, the East India Company brought thousands of Indian lascars, scholars and workers 
 (who were largely Bengali and/or Muslim) to Britain largely to work on ships and in ports. Some of whom settled down and took local
 British wives, partly due to a lack of Indian women in Britain and also abandonment due to restrictions on South Asian crew members
 being employed on British ships such as the Navigation Acts. It is estimated 8,000 Indians (a proportion being lascar sailors) 
 lived in Britain permanently prior to the 1950s. Due to the majority of early Asian immigrants being lascar seamen, the 
 earliest Indian communities were found in port towns. Naval cooks also came, many of them from the Sylhet Division of what is now 
 Bangladesh. One of the most famous early Bengali immigrants to Britain was Sake Dean Mahomet, a captain of the British East India 
 Company. In 1810, he founded London's first Indian restaurant, the Hindoostanee Coffee House. He is also valued for introducing shampoo
 and therapeutic massage to the United Kingdom. By the mid-19th century, there were more than 40,000 Indian seamen, diplomats,
 scholars, soldiers, officials, tourists, businessmen and students in Britain, the majority of them being seamen working on ships,
 Lascars lodged in British ports in between voyages. Most Indians during this period would visit or reside in Britain temporarily,
 returning to India after months or several years, bringing back knowledge about Britain in the process.</font></p>

 <font size="+2" align="right">The 1931 Census of India estimated that there were at least 2,000 Indian students in English and Scottish
 Universities at the time, from an estimated, and overwhelmingly male population of 9,243 South Asians on the British mainland, of which

<u>People born in India are the UK's largest foreign-born population, totalling an estimated 880,000 in 2020.</u>
